                                FINAL PROJECT: 2-WAY TRAFFIC LIGHT SYSTEM
```
In this project, the STM32F103RB is used to simulate the 2-way traffic light system, having some main features:
  Automaitc mode: The system operates as normal. The light colors are red, yellow and green.
  Mannual mode: A button is used to switch the light colors in this mode
  Tuning mode: This mode is used to modify the light timing length
  Pedestrian scramble: When the button for pedestrian pressed, its light is turn on and operates reversely to the light of vehicles.
```
